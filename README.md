This is the final project of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree

Your Home Service Robot
Now itâ€™s time to simulate a full home service robot capable of navigating to pick up and deliver virtual objects. To do so, the add_markers and pick_objects node should be communicating. Or, more precisely, the add_markers node should subscribe to your odometry to keep track of your robot pose.

Modify the add_markers node as follows:

Initially show the marker at the pickup zone
Hide the marker once your robot reaches the pickup zone
Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup
Show the marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches it

To run this program, run the following command in the terminal:

$ cd home/robond/catkin_ws/

$ source devel/setup.bash

$ catkin_make

$ cd home/robond/catkin_ws/src/scripts

$ ./home_service.sh

##Packages

The gmapping package was used to perform SLAM and build a map of the environment with a robot equipped with laser range finder sensors or RGB-D cameras.

The turtlebot_teleop package was used to operate and move the robot manually.

The turtlebot_rviz_launchers enables a preconfigured rviz with robot model, trajectories and a map loaded. It allows for the visualization of entire robot model, laser data, AMCL particle cloud localization and map.

The turtlebot_gazebo package enables the deployment of a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it.
